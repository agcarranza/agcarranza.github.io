Hello! My name is Aldo. I'm a PhD student at the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/)), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Susan Athey](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/susan-athey/).
My research mainly deals with personalized decision-making and recommendation systems.
In my core research, I explore a range of topics in bandit learning, federated learning, causal inference, differential privacy, and language models.
I am continually looking to broaden my understanding in areas of machine learning.
I'm always open to discussions about topics of mutual interest, so please feel free to get in touch.

Please find my [CV](https://agcarranza.github.io/files/CV.pdf) here.
