Hello! My name is Aldo. I am a PhD student at Stanford University in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering ([ICME](https://icme.stanford.edu/)). I have the privilege of being advised by Professor [Susan Athey](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/susan-athey/).
My research focuses on topics in personalized decision-making and recommendation. In my core research, I explore topics in bandit learning, federated learning, causal inference, differential privacy, and language models.
I'm always eager to broaden my understanding in many areas of machine learning.

Please find my [CV](https://agcarranza.github.io/files/CV.pdf) here.
